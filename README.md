    $ go get https://github.com/RunxiaWan/PcapParser

Build gopacket first

Then build 'PcapParser'

    $ go build github.com/RunxiaWan/PcapParser

You can simply run PcapParser by

    ./PcapParser -in input -out output
'input' is the file path of input pcap file and output is the file path of output pcap file. To see the dicription of Other option:
